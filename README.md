## Why Nushell?

Nushell is used in this action because of its ability to provide gorgeous, highly readable output. Its structured data model allows for elegant manipulation and presentation of Kubeconform's JSON results, making it much easier to interpret validation outcomes. This ensures that developers can quickly identify issues in their Kustomize projects and take necessary corrective actions.
